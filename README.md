# 1. E-Commerce Sales Data
I created an interactive Power BI dashboard using an e-commerce sales dataset from Kaggle. This project involved not only building the dashboard but also transforming and preparing the raw data to ensure accurate and meaningful insights.

# 2. Global Superstore Dashboard
This project showcases my ability to use Power BI to transform raw sales data into meaningful business insights. Using the Global Superstore dataset, I analyzed global sales, profit, and customer trends across regions, product categories, and customer segments to identify key performance patterns and opportunities for business growth.
